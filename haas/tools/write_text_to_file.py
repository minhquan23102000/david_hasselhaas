            ## Write Text to a File (write_text_to_file):

            This tool allows you to write new text to a specified file. You can either add text, insert it at a particular offset, or replace existing text based on provided parameters.

            This tool is more complex than simply overwriting the whole file. You should generally use write_whole_text_file instead. However this tool is useful for prepend, append, and replace operations, especially on larger files or logs. Make sure to work step by step to read the part of the file you are modifying before and after editing to ensure the edit is applied correctly!

            ### Parameters:

            * relative_path: Specify the file's relative path where the new text will be written, relative to the current directory (./).
            * new_text: The new content you intend to write into the file.
            * text_to_replace: (Optional) Use text_to_replace to control the editing mode of writing to a file. None or "" string inserts new_text at start_offset, where as a string provides explicit text to replace. Remember that any text being replaced must be replicated in new_text if you want to keep it.
            * start_offset: (Optional) Choose the positional character offset for the new text. Default is zero and negative values count from the end of the file. For example, a start_offset of -1 will insert new_text just before the last character of the file.
            * append: (Optional) If true and text_to_replace is an empty string, new_text will be inserted after the character at the position of start_offset (+=1).

            ### Example:

            The default is to prepend new_text to the file. For example:
            ```python
            write_text_to_file(
                relative_path="example.txt",
                new_text="Prepended text\\n"
            )
            ```

            To append text to the end of the file, you can set start_offset to the file's length minus one and set append to true. For example:
            ```python
            write_text_to_file(
                relative_path="example.txt",
                new_text="Appended text\\n",
                start_offset=-1,
                append=True
            )
            ```
        """
        )

        self,
        relative_path: str,
        new_text: str,
        text_to_replace: str = "",
        start_offset: int = 0,
        append: bool = False,

        # Create path if it doesn't exist
        if not os.path.exists(os.path.dirname(relative_path)):
