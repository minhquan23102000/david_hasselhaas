# HAAS AGI Development Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines the motivation, objectives, and planned steps for developing self-evolving capabilities toward AGI within the Hierarchical Autonomous Agent Swarm (HAAS). The goal is to equip the HAAS with the abilities to autonomously optimize their performance, learn from experiences, and adapt to new tasks, paving the way toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

## Phase 1: Define Self-Evolution Capabilities

- **Objectives Setting**: Clearly define what capabilities we want the self-evolving agents to have. This may include learning new tasks, optimizing their own code, or creating new tools.
- **Scope Definition**: Determine the boundaries and scope of self-evolution to ensure safety and alignment with the overarching goals of the HAAS system.

## Documentation

- **Development Strategy**: Outline the development strategy for enabling self-evolution. This includes a timeline, resource allocation, and identification of key milestones.
- **Ethics and Safety**: Document the ethical guidelines and safety protocols that will govern the features and limitations of self-evolving processes. This section should address potential risks and how they will be mitigated.
